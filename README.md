# User Authentication and Management:
Implementing user authentication is usually one of the first steps because it's fundamental to many other features. Without knowing who the user is, you can't associate a wallet, personalize content, or save user-specific data like blog posts or comments.

# Database Models/Schemas Expansion:
Once authentication is in place, you'll need a database to store user information and other data. Expanding your database schemas to include all necessary models is critical before you start building the frontend that relies on this data.

# User Wallet Association:
After setting up the user authentication and database, you can work on the logic for creating or associating a Solana wallet with the user's account. This step is essential for the NFT functionality to work.

# Smart Contract for NFT Minting:
Parallel to the wallet association or immediately after, you should begin the smart contract development. This is because the contract will dictate some of the frontend logic for minting NFTs, and you'll need to test the integration between your application and the Solana blockchain.

# Frontend for Blog Page:
With the backend setup progressing, you can start developing the frontend. You can work on static components first, then integrate dynamic data as your backend APIs become available.

# Minting UI:
Once the smart contract is ready, you can implement the minting UI. This will allow users to interact with the smart contract through your website to mint NFTs.

# System Design Document:
Although listed last, the system design document should be an ongoing task. You should update it as your understanding of the system evolves and as you make decisions about architecture, technologies, and design.
